What is ESP32?

ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. The ESP32 series employs either a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core variations, Xtensa LX7 dual-core microprocessor or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor and includes built-in antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power-management modules. ESP32 is created and developed by Espressif Systems, a Shanghai-based Chinese company, and is manufactured by TSMC using their 40 nm process.[2] It is a successor to the ESP8266 Microcontroller.



ESP32 Applications:


The ESP32 modules are commonly found in the following IoT devices:

Smart industrial devices, including Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)


Smart medical devices, including wearable health monitors


Smart energy devices, including HVAC and thermostats


Smart security devices, including surveillance cameras and smart locks


How the code works:

this project is has four leds that turn on and off (forward , backward , left , right )

Turn on the green LED if the URL contains the word "right"
